# EOS-hosts-block

## What is this?

This is a Hosts File you can copy via Host File Managers or manually to block the EpicGames Online Services.
Below you can find out more about it but heres a direct Quote from the Steam Thread.

```
For those unaware, Epic is adding their own counterpart to Steamworks to more and more games, 
old and new, single or multiplayer and in many cases games that have been out for years have 
had EOS added retroactively.

While Epic markets Epic Online Services (EOS) as a "store agnostic" infrastructure for cross-platform 
multiplayer and achievements, games that have had EOS added retroactively like Killing Floor 2 and 
Remnant from the Ashes reported myriad connection issues for players after the updates in which EOS 
was added.

Epic also uses EOS to yet again collect telemetry on player IP addresses, hardware, 
gaming sessions (among others) in yet another way of involving themselves in games that, 
in some cases, are neither made with Unreal or even released on EGS.
